            File Organizer with Tree

            This is a global command line application using Node.js
            Organize all your files of given directory (if not given then current directory)
             into different sections so that you don't have to do that manually

            You can also add some more extensions according to your file types by going through
             (commands->organize.js and editing types variable)

            Type help if you find any difficulty in using this application
